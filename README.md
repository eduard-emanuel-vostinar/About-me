- 👋Hello there! I am a human being, practicing web development as my main career orientation. I am presently specialized on the front-end part of this niche with an ongoing development towards back-end, ultimately aiming for achieving the rank of a “full-stack developer”. 
Because I constantly believed there is always room to develop new skills, I also practice photography and videography, as well as editing, graphic/ sound/ color design, story telling and story writing.  
My experience in working with a wide range of people over the last years has taught me essential soft-skills such as:
· Social Engineering.
· High Adaptability.
· Resilience. 
· Excellent time management.
· Leadership
· Teamwork :)

My drive comes from my wishful character to help the people I encounter on my path. I believe in a set of principles, I am a man of order and routine. Everything I aim to achieve and build, I do so in order to give- share with my peers. 
John 13:34- “A new commandment I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also must love one another. “
